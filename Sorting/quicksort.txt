//Picking a pivot

The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot
ideally the pivot should be chosen so that its roughly the median value in the data set you are sorting
for simplicity we will always choose the pivot to be first element

//Pivot Pseudocode

It will accept three args : array , start and end index (default to 0 and array length - 1 resp )
grab the pivot from start of array
store the current pivot index in a variable
loop through the array from the start until the end, if pivot is greater than current element, increment the
pivot index variable and then swap the current element with the element at the pivot index. 
swap the starting element with pivot index
return the pivot index

//quicksort Pseudocode
call the pivot helper on the array
when the helper returns you the updated pivot index, recursively call the pivot helper on the subarray to the
left of that index and the subarray to the right of that index.
your base case occurs when you consider a subarray with less than 2 elements.
