## Selection Sort Algorithm

 1. Store the first element as the smallest element you have seen so far
 2. Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
 3. If a smaller number is found, designate the smaller number to be the new minimum and continue 
    till the end of the array
 4. If the minimum is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
 5. Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
