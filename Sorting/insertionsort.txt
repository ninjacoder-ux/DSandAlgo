## Insertion Sort Algorithm

1. Start by picking the second element in array
2. Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
3. Continue to the next element and if it  is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted
    portion (left side) to place the element in correct place
4. Repeat until the array is sorted.
