About and Todo
---------------------------------------------------------

Divide and Conquer.
Divide the whole array into groups until arrays with 0 or 1 element are obtained.
merge individual 1 element array into groups while sorting them until the whole array is merged and therefore 
sorted.

Implement a function responsible for merging two sorted arrays.
If given two arrays are sorted this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted and 
consists of all the elements in the two input arrays.
this function should run in O(n+m) time and space and should not modify the parameters passed to it.

Pseudocode
----------------------------------------------------------

// for merge function
Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array
While there are still values we haven't looked at,
    If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first 
    array into our results and move on to the next value in the first array.
    If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second 
    array into our results and move on to the next value in the second array.
    Once we exhaust one array, push all the remaining values from the other array.

// for splitting the array and returning result
Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full
length of the array
Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted) array.
